The data structure I chose to implement is: 
    - an array of slots (because there is a limited number of possible slots - 256)
    - where each slot points to a linked list (to a node - the 1st channel if exists, NULL otherwise) of the channels associated with it [linked list bcs for each message slot file, assuming that no more than 2^20 message channels in use - bad memory complexity in case of use of few channels &  the channel ids wont defenitally be smaller than 2^20 -> a channel ID as the cell index in the array will not work...]
    - the messages are saved as data in the relevant channel */
